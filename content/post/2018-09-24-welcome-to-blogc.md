You’ll find this post in your `content/post` directory. Go ahead and edit it
and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many
different ways, but the most common way is to run `blogc-make runserver`, which
launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `content/post` directory and
includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to
get an idea about how it works.

blogc also offers powerful support for code snippets: like these

	def print_hi(name)
	  puts "Hi, #{name}"
	end
	print_hi('Tom')
	#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
